<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

***3 patti ? but why ?***
- Because before the pandemic 3-patti used to be one of our favourite card games :confused: 
- And there is no web-based multi-player 3-patti application online currently( guess everyone likes poker after all).
- So we decided to make one ourselves modelling our application on the more popular skribble.io :smiley:

***but why decentralised ?***
- There is no user sign-up required for playing in our application, so trust and fraud-prevention were one of our topmost priorities.
- Naturally blockchain was the most obvious solution that came to us, because the user only needs to connect using their wallet providing complete anonymity to the user.
- Moreover all transactions are handled by smart contract to enforce rules of the game(such as transferring money to pot for placing bet).
